- This table includes both global (network-wide) and nodal metrics.
- For more detail about the metric definitions, see the Brain Connectivity Toolbox (https://sites.google.com/site/bctnet/list-of-measures).
- Variables are named according to the following scheme:

  <weighted or binary>_<metric name>_<ROI atlas name>_<ROI number>_<threshold network density or averaging method>

where:
  weighted or binary:
    w: metric computed in weighted network
    b: metric computed in binary network

  metric name:
    betweenness: betweenness centrality (nodal)

    charpath: characteristic path length (global)
	       
    charpath_rand_mean: average characteristic path length across 100 random network with same size and edge weight distribution (global)
	       
    lambda: characteristic path length relative to a random network (i.e. charpath/charpath_rand_mean) (global)
	       
    clustering_coefficient: clustering coefficient (nodal)

    global_clustering_coefficient: average clustering coefficient across nodes (global)

    global_clustering_coefficient_rand_mean: average clustering coefficient across nodes in 100 random networks with same size and edge weight distribution (global)
	       
    gamma: average clustering coefficient across nodes relative to a random network (i.e. global_clustering_coefficient/global_clustering_coefficient_rand_mean) (global)
	       
    degree: degree centrality (global)
	       
    sigma: small worldness (sigma/lambda) (global)
	       
    local_efficiency: local efficiency (nodal)
	       
    network_local_efficiency: local efficiency averaged across nodes (global)
	       
    transitivity: transitivity (global)
	       
    modularity: modularity (global)

  ROI atlas name:
    cba: 92 primarily grey matter regions defined in the CerebrA atlas

  ROI number: number corresponding to ROI

  threshold network density or averaging method:
    thresh_[density]: metric computed at specific network density threshold

    auc: sum of metric across all density thresholds (here 0.01, 0.02, ..., 0.10). This is often used in papers, but I prefer the next method ('intmean') since it keeps the values in an interpretable range.

    intmean: mean of metric across density thresholds approximated using the trapezoidal rule (method used in Selvanathan paper)

Examples:
  w_modularity_thresh_0.03: modularity metric computed at a density threshold of 0.03

  w_local_efficiency_aal_91_thresh_0.10: local efficiency in the left cerebellar hemisphere computed at network density 0.10

  w_transitivity_intmean: average transitivy across all network densities
